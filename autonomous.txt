How does autonomous mode work?





what to do when the control hub is off during the competition and I can't edit the code


To-do list for today:
- Get the motor directions right
- Test autonomous
- If it works, switch to RUN_TO_POSITION

Now what:
- Turn the moving code into a function, and also write code to move the robot to left, right, back
- Is busy??
- Write code to turn the robot by a given number of degrees
- Turn it into a sequence (move left, forward, turn...) then shoot balls at the end?
